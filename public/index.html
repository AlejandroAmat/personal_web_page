                            <h3 > Together with 12 students from UPC, I led the technical part of a project in a groundbreaking collaboration with HP. Our mission was to enhance efficiency and precision in the construction sector by developing an algorithm that would complement HP's innovative HP SitePrint robot. This robot used an integrated Intel RealSense D435i camera to mark internal divisions in buildings, including internal walls and door placements.
                               
                                Our primary challenge was to create an algorithm capable of comparing the constructed reality of a building with the original architectural plans, detecting any inconsistencies and promptly alerting the user to prevent inaccurate markings. Python was our language of choice, recommended by HP for its extensive library support, which streamlined our development process.

                                <br><br>
                               
                                The project timeline was punctuated by several adjustments and setbacks in various sprints. Despite these challenges, our team persevered and developed a Python library that could be readily uploaded to the official Python repository, PyPI. This strategic approach made it effortless for users to discover, download, and install our library using standard tools like pip. The library also offered versioning support to facilitate ongoing improvements and boasted seamless integration with a variety of development tools.
                                <br><br>
                                In our system design documentation, we implemented an Object-Oriented Paradigm, resulting in meticulously structured and organized code. We created an algorithm that relied on two essential distance measurements: theoretical and real. These were achieved by harnessing the point cloud data from the Intel RealSense D435i camera, coupled with a variety of Python libraries. Our library relied on the following libraries: pyrealsense2, numpy, cv2, open3d, imageio, matplotlib, math, ast, and OS.
                                <br><br>
                                
                                One of the pivotal aspects of our project was point cloud segmentation. We aimed to create a precise 3D representation of the environment using a point cloud. To accurately calculate distances to the desired objects, we meticulously separated them from irrelevant points through segmentation. This approach allowed for accurate calculations of distances to multiple objects and worked effectively in diverse scenarios.
                                <br><br>
                                For non-tilted or angled structures such as walls and columns, we employed plane segmentation to detect and measure them. However, for structures with varying angles, we integrated the DBSCAN algorithm. This update was instrumental in detecting and segmenting these structures with remarkable accuracy.
                                
                                By selecting relevant clusters based on variance and the number of points, our algorithm successfully identified the desired objects. We retained only the largest areas, often the ones of greatest interest, and calculated the distance to them. This distance was then compared to the theoretical values to detect any discrepancies, ensuring an error rate of less than 3% across the camera's operational range.
                                <br><br>
                                Our system characterization involved rigorous testing in a controlled environment, featuring a mock-up room equipped with millimeter markings to enable precise measurements. We compared the exact physical distances, determined through these markings, with the distances calculated by our software to ensure its precise operation.
                                
                                Through extensive testing and adjustments, we established a maximum accuracy threshold, agreeing that no more than a 2% error in measured distances was acceptable. We further represented the progressive improvement in accuracy through a graphical presentation, with optimal performance observed within a specific distance range of 0.6 to 1.8 meters.

The main idea of the algorythm is to create a Normalized Histogram of skin pixel values obtained from all the Training Set Images (As we previously know the pixels with skin) and another one with the non-skin pixel values. In order to compute this 2-dimensional histogram we first need to obtain a base where a pixel can be defined with two values. After examination, the chosen color base is YCrCb. 
                                 The histogram wil be computed with Cr (Red Difference Crominance) and Cb and will not contemplate Y (luminance). <br><br> When normalizing both histograms by their p(x_i) {x1=skin_pixel, x2=no_skin_pixel} we obtain two histograms that represent the conditioned probabilities of each succes. In order to compute if an input pixel is skin or not, we compare both probabilites refered to that level of Cr-Cb through Bayesian Decision. <br><br> To check the code at Github:   <strong><a href="https://github.com/AlejandroAmat/PIV ">link</a></strong>   <br> For a more detailed explanation:   <strong><a href="mem_1.1.1.pdf ">Document</a></strong></h3>

                    From here, the algorythm consists of applying a series of morphological openings and closings while playing with the distance function. Combining these aspects we are able to keep the elements with a certain width; Being so, the fingers and in some cases parts of the arm. <br> <br>
                    As it is, a post-processing algorythm is implemented in order to not take into account the wider elements that do not belong to the finger set. For this, size, distance and shape are taken into account and finally the number of disjoint elements is computed.

In order to achieve this, the server consults a Relational MySQL DataBase stored locally at my computer. This DataBase contains all the users with their marks, schedule and tasks. So, when the server receives an HTTP GET request (which in our case were included in the url as : "ip_addres?xxx&xxx&xxx
                    ") it processes the restrictions and data and translates it to a SQL petition.

As JavaScript supports asynchronous methods, we did not have to implement threads and distributed paradigmas. The Android client was done using Java.

                            <h3 >
                            This project consisted of creating from scratch (or nearly) a basic & functional Operating System Kernel. It was basically programmed in C and x86 assembler, as accesing system memory data was needed. This can only be done by entering Protected mode or System mode (Which can only be activated by assembler code. In our case, the call to: 'Sysenter'. There are more). As we did not do the File System, the functionalities and goals can be divided in 2: <br><br>  <strong>Interruptions & Syscalls: </strong> <br><br>Interruptions & Syscalls have nearly the same behaviour so I will only mention Syscalls which are more complex. Basically a Syscall is a method that is managed by the Operating System and has to acces protected mode to execute it. Fork(), write(), read() & open() are some examples. As you may notice, it has to enter system mode as the call is accessing Hardware and Structures not accesible to the user. <br><br> The first thing that is needed is a Wrapper for the Syscall. This is used to try to have compatibility in diferent Operating Systems. When calling a Syscall, it will again call the Wrapper. This Wrapper is in assembly code and is in charge of passing the parameters of the function (By moving the registers relative to EBP to the stack), stacking the value of the call from the Syscall Table and then entering System Mode. Once here, we access the SystemCall Handler. Its responsible for saving the user's Stack and managing the System Stack (saving Hardware registries pointing to the point of the stack or to the next user instruction). It also checks if the value passed as parameter refering to the number os Syscall is available at the Syscall Table, which it will after call. This is pointing to the direction of memory where the code for sys_call is found. Depending on the call, the code will be different. It is done in C.
                         <br> <br> <strong>Process Management:</strong> <br><br> Processes are the fundamental element in any OS. They do everything. For a process to be considered as so a System structure is needed. In our case, we used a defined t_struct where we had the Identifier of the process (4bytes), the process stack (1024bytes), the actual state (4bytes) and a pointer to another process in the same state (4bytes). <br> <br> Knowing the state of the process is crucial because they are divided (in very simple OS) in 4 categories: RUNNING (process taking CPU), READY (ready to take CPU), WAITING (suspended due to a syscall or interrupt), ZOMBIE (killed process but still not confirmed by parent). We could also consider NEW, but in our case we set them to READY just when forking(). So, one of the most important things to do is create a system that tells the CPU which process choose to run. For this, we checked every clock interrupt (That depends on the Processor frequency) how much time a process had been running. We would then, based on some principle, get one of the processes in the READY queue (Which was not a queue structure but pointers to other processes) and put it to run. This is known as the Task_switch(). 
                        <br><br>Finally, the most complex part was doing the fork(). It is important to understand that all processes have a Parent (Except INIT{0}) so everytime a new process is created it is due to a cloning of the parent. This is, the fork(). The complexity of this call resides in the cloning of memory from one process to another. This is due to the fact that every process has its own "Instruction translator
                    " called Page table which translates its logical directions to physical ones. The problem is that when we fork() we have to change this Page Table; So accessing again the father's memory directions requires an alternative solution. I will not give more details about this but you may check the code at Github.  It is worth mentioning, that previously it is important to check if there are enough physical pages in memory to clone the process. Finally, after asigning a PID (Process Identifier) the system is ready to perform the task_switch. In our case, as our process structure included the PID with the stack, when copying it, we did not have to copy the stack again in the memory allocation process. <br><br> To check the complete and explained code at Github:   <strong><a href="https://github.com/AlejandroAmat/ZEOS_kernel_implementation ">link</a></strong> </h3>

                            <strong>(1) Vocal Activity Detection </strong> <br><br> In this project we implemented a system that could detect which parts of an input audio file (.wav) were noise and which were vocal activity. <br> In order to do this a FSM (Finite State Machine) is created. With the following states: SILENCE, MAYBE SILENCE, VOICED, MAYBE VOICED, UNKNOWN. For us to understand the weight of transition we establish 
                            2 criteria: ZCR (zero crossing rate) and power (signal power in dB). It is worth mentioning that all files have different SNR (sound to noise ratio) so establishing a treshold depends on the type of file. This is why we establish the power tresholds by computing the logarithmic mean of the 15 first audio frames. <br><br>
                            By this point, we transition through the different states as:

                               We take into account the ZCR as some fricative alophones such as [s],[z]... Have very small power and high ZCR.
                               Finally, we modify the .wav file by putting to 0 all the samples detected as SILENCE so a 'Noise cancellation system' is created.

                         In this project  I tackled the task of pitch detection and sonority analysis in C++. I used the autocorrelation method to compute the pitch of input audio files, taking into account the pitch frequencies. The autocorrelation function was a valuable tool in this process as it allowed me to measure the similarity between a signal and a time-shifted version of itself. The pitch frequency was then estimated based on the lag at which the autocorrelation function reached its maximum value.
                          <BR></BR>          
                         I also implemented a sonority detector that considered changes in the autocorrelation of nearby samples, power, and zero-crossing rate (ZCR). These metrics were crucial in detecting the presence of sound and determining its relative strength or sonority.
                         <br><br>

                         To optimize the performance of the algorithm, I fine-tuned the thresholds using bash scripting. This allowed me to adjust the parameters to get the best results possible.
                         <BR></BR>
                         I believe that these methods are useful in audio processing and music analysis as they allow for the extraction of meaningful information from audio signals. The autocorrelation method provides an accurate estimation of the fundamental frequency of a sound, which is critical for tasks such as melody and harmony recognition, music transcription, and audio classification. The consideration of additional metrics like power and ZCR adds to the robustness of the algorithm, making it a valuable tool for sonority analysis.

                         <strong>(3) Voice Estimation and Validation with GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) and filter predictor (LP, MFCC, LPC)</strong>  <br><br>
                         In this project I tackled the task of audio recognition and verification using various signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. I used Linear Prediction (LP), Linear Predictive Coding (LPC), and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm to achieve this goal.
                                <br><br>
                         Linear Prediction (LP) is a technique that uses past samples of a signal to predict future samples. It provides a mathematical model of the signal's behavior, which can then be used for various purposes, including speech analysis and coding.
                         <br><br>
                         Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) is a more advanced version of LP that uses a filter to model the vocal tract and speech production process. LPC is widely used in speech processing and is considered to be a more accurate representation of speech signals.
                         <br><br>
                         Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is a feature extraction technique used in speech and music analysis. MFCCs are calculated from the Mel-frequency spectrogram of an audio signal and are widely used in various applications, including speech recognition and music information retrieval.
                         <br><br>
                         In this project, I combined these three techniques with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm to perform audio recognition and verification. GMMs are probabilistic models that model the distribution of data and are often used in speech recognition.
                         <br><br>
                         To evaluate the performance of the approach, I conducted tests on a very large database of audio files (Corpus). Additionally, I optimized the coefficient order with bash scripting, allowing me to fine-tune the performance of the algorithm.
                         <br><br>
                         Comparing the three techniques, MFCCs provide a compact and efficient representation of audio signals, making them well-suited for use in speech recognition and other audio-related applications. LPC provides a more detailed representation of the speech signal, but it is computationally more demanding and may not be suitable for all applications. LP is a simple and efficient technique, but it may not be as accurate as LPC or MFCC.
                         <br><br>
                         In conclusion, the combination of LP, LPC, and MFCC with the GMM algorithm is a powerful approach to audio recognition and verification. Each technique provides a different representation of the audio signal, and the GMM algorithm provides a means to model the underlying distribution of the data. By considering multiple representations and models, this approach can achieve high accuracy and robustness in audio recognition and verification tasks. The tests conducted on a large corpus of audio files showed the effectiveness of the approach, and the optimization of the coefficient order with bash scripting further improved the performance of the algorithm.

                            <strong>(1) Creation of certificates </strong> <br><br> 
                            Creating a Certificate Authority (CA), a certificate for a server, and a certificate for a user: In this project, we utilized Linux to create our own CA and generate server and user certificates. To create the CA, we used OpenSSL and issued the following terminal commands:

                            <br><br>
                            openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca.key
                            <br>
                            openssl req -key ca.key -new -x509 -out ca.crt
                            <br><br>
                            To generate the server and user certificates, we used the following commands:
                            <br><br>
                            openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key<br>
                            openssl req -key server.key -new -out server.csr<br>
                            openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -out server.crt<br><br>
                            
                            And for the user certificate:
                            <br><br>
                            openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out user.key<br>
                            openssl req -key user.key -new -out user.csr<br>
                            openssl x509 -req -in user.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -out user.crt<br><br>
                            
                            To include the CA and certificate in Firefox, we needed to go to the preferences menu, select the "Privacy & Security" section, and import the CA and certificate.
                         <br> <br> <strong>(2) Iptables configuration</strong> <br><br> 
                                
                        To access certain websites and block certain connections: iptables is a Linux command-line utility used to configure the firewall. To access certain websites, we used the following command:
                        <br><br>       
                        
                         iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -d [website_IP_address] -j ACCEPT
                         <br><br>
                         To block certain connections, we used the following command:
                         <br><br>
                         iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport [port_number] -j DROP
                         <br><br>

                         <strong>(4) Web vulnerabilities</strong>  <br><br>
                         In this project, we used a web suite to detect various web vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). We also used Wireshark to modify the content of packages, modify JavaScript, perform cookie stealing, and simulate SQL injection attacks. These vulnerabilities can compromise the security and confidentiality of sensitive information stored on a website.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>(5) Operating system malware</strong>  <br><br>
                        In this project, we developed a Messenger program that sends user data to a mail server. We then used a fake DNS and mail capturer to send the mail to our catcher and detect certain details. By analyzing the binary code and compiler, as well as the registry, we were able to detect where the error occurred and identify the malware.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>(6) Forensic analysis of disk</strong>  <br><br>
                        In this project, we performed a forensic analysis of a disk to detect deleted files, altered sectors, and other malicious activity. We used various tools to recover and analyze the disk's contents, including disk imaging tools, file carving tools, and registry
