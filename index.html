The main idea of the algorythm is to create a Normalized Histogram of skin pixel values obtained from all the Training Set Images (As we previously know the pixels with skin) and another one with the non-skin pixel values. In order to compute this 2-dimensional histogram we first need to obtain a base where a pixel can be defined with two values. After examination, the chosen color base is YCrCb. The histogram wil be computed with Cr (Red Difference Crominance) and Cb and will not contemplate Y (luminance). <br><br> When normalizing both histograms by their p(x_i) {x1=skin_pixel, x2=no_skin_pixel} we obtain two histograms that represent the conditioned probabilities of each succes. In order to compute if an input pixel is skin or not, we compare both probabilites refered to that level of Cr-Cb through Bayesian Decision. <br><br> To check the code at Github:   <strong><a href="https://github.com/AlejandroAmat/PIV ">link</a></strong>   <br> For a more detailed explanation:   <strong><a href="mem_1.1.1.pdf">Document</a></strong></h3>

                    From here, the algorythm consists of applying a series of morphological openings and closings while playing with the distance function. Combining these aspects we are able to keep the elements with a certain width; Being so, the fingers and in some cases parts of the arm. <br> <br>
                    As it is, a post-processing algorythm is implemented in order to not take into account the wider elements that do not belong to the finger set. For this, size, distance and shape are taken into account and finally the number of disjoint elements is computed.

The server was made in JavaScript using the Node.js library, and is responsible of managing the input (HTTP get requests) from the diverse clients. In order to achieve this, the server consults a Relational MySQL DataBase stored locally at my computer. This DataBase contains all the users with their marks, schedule and tasks. So, when the server receives an HTTP GET request (which in our case were included in the url as : "ip_addres?xxx&xxx&xxx
                    ") it processes the restrictions and data and translates it to a SQL petition. It sends it to the DataBase, and once it receives response it returns it in .JSON format to the respective clients. <br> Finally, we made 3 different clients : <small><strong>Web App, Android and RaspberryPi with Ruby</strong></small> <br> <br> The WebApp Client was made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. As JavaScript supports asynchronous methods, we did not have to implement threads and distributed paradigmas. The Android client was done using Java. Finally, for the Ruby client we had to use thread implementation in order to not freeze the graphics system while waiting for a response. It is worth mentioning that in the Ruby client we created a Radio-Frequency-Identification(RFID) method using the Raspberry to authenticate in the server with our University cards. <br><br> To check the Server & Ruby client code at Github:   <strong><a href="https://github.com/AlejandroAmat/CLIENT-SERVER-MODEL/ ">link</a></strong> <br>To check the Android & WebClient code at Github:   <strong><a href="https://github.com/AlejandroAmat/client-server-webApp-Andorid ">link</a></strong>  <br> For a more detailed explanation and documentation you may visit this page: <em>to do</em></h3>

                            <h3 >
                            This project consisted of creating from scratch (or nearly) a basic & functional Operating System Kernel. It was basically programmed in C and x86 assembler, as accesing system memory data was needed. This can only be done by entering Protected mode or System mode (Which can only be activated by assembler code. In our case, the call to: 'Sysenter'. There are more). As we did not do the File System, the functionalities and goals can be divided in 2: <br><br>  <strong>Interruptions & Syscalls: </strong> <br><br>Interruptions & Syscalls have nearly the same behaviour so I will only mention Syscalls which are more complex. Basically a Syscall is a method that is managed by the Operating System and has to acces protected mode to execute it. Fork(), write(), read() & open() are some examples. As you may notice, it has to enter system mode as the call is accessing Hardware and Structures not accesible to the user. <br><br> The first thing that is needed is a Wrapper for the Syscall. This is used to try to have compatibility in diferent Operating Systems. When calling a Syscall, it will again call the Wrapper. This Wrapper is in assembly code and is in charge of passing the parameters of the function (By moving the registers relative to EBP to the stack), stacking the value of the call from the Syscall Table and then entering System Mode. Once here, we access the SystemCall Handler. Its responsible for saving the user's Stack and managing the System Stack (saving Hardware registries pointing to the point of the stack or to the next user instruction). It also checks if the value passed as parameter refering to the number os Syscall is available at the Syscall Table, which it will after call. This is pointing to the direction of memory where the code for sys_call is found. Depending on the call, the code will be different. It is done in C.
                         <br> <br> <strong>Process Management:</strong> <br><br> Processes are the fundamental element in any OS. They do everything. For a process to be considered as so a System structure is needed. In our case, we used a defined t_struct where we had the Identifier of the process (4bytes), the process stack (1024bytes), the actual state (4bytes) and a pointer to another process in the same state (4bytes). <br> <br> Knowing the state of the process is crucial because they are divided (in very simple OS) in 4 categories: RUNNING (process taking CPU), READY (ready to take CPU), WAITING (suspended due to a syscall or interrupt), ZOMBIE (killed process but still not confirmed by parent). We could also consider NEW, but in our case we set them to READY just when forking(). So, one of the most important things to do is create a system that tells the CPU which process choose to run. For this, we checked every clock interrupt (That depends on the Processor frequency) how much time a process had been running. We would then, based on some principle, get one of the processes in the READY queue (Which was not a queue structure but pointers to other processes) and put it to run. This is known as the Task_switch(). 
                        <br><br>Finally, the most complex part was doing the fork(). It is important to understand that all processes have a Parent (Except INIT{0}) so everytime a new process is created it is due to a cloning of the parent. This is, the fork(). The complexity of this call resides in the cloning of memory from one process to another. This is due to the fact that every process has its own "Instruction translator
                    " called Page table which translates its logical directions to physical ones. The problem is that when we fork() we have to change this Page Table; So accessing again the father's memory directions requires an alternative solution. I will not give more details about this but you may check the code at Github.  It is worth mentioning, that previously it is important to check if there are enough physical pages in memory to clone the process. Finally, after asigning a PID (Process Identifier) the system is ready to perform the task_switch. In our case, as our process structure included the PID with the stack, when copying it, we did not have to copy the stack again in the memory allocation process. <br><br> To check the complete and explained code at Github:   <strong><a href="https://github.com/AlejandroAmat/ZEOS_kernel_implementation">link</a></strong> </h3>

                            <strong>(1) Vocal Activity Detection </strong> <br><br> In this project we implemented a system that could detect which parts of an input audio file (.wav) were noise and which were vocal activity. <br> In order to do this a FSM (Finite State Machine) is created. With the following states: SILENCE, MAYBE SILENCE, VOICED, MAYBE VOICED, UNKNOWN. For us to understand the weight of transition we establish 
                            2 criteria: ZCR (zero crossing rate) and power (signal power in dB). It is worth mentioning that all files have different SNR (sound to noise ratio) so establishing a treshold depends on the type of file. This is why we establish the power tresholds by computing the logarithmic mean of the 15 first audio frames. <br><br>
                            By this point, we transition through the different states as:
                                <br><br>
                               <strong>SILENCE->MAYBE VOICED</strong>   If the power of the frame samples is greater than Treshold1. 
                               <br><br>
                               <strong>VOICED->MAYBE SILENCE</strong>   If the power of the frame samples is lower than Treshold2.
                               <br><br>
                               <strong>MAYBE VOICED->VOICED</strong>   If the time spent in MAYBE VOICE is bigger than certain T or the power is greater than (alpha+Treshold1). 
                               <br><br>
                               <strong>MAYBE VOICED->SILENCE</strong>   If the power of the frame samples is lower than Treshold1.
                               <br><br>
                               <strong>MAYBE SILENCE->VOICED</strong>   If the power of the frame samples is greater than Treshold2. 
                               <br><br>
                               <strong>MAYBE SILENCE->SILENCE</strong>  If the time spent in MAYBE SILENCE is bigger than certain T or the power is lower than (Treshold2-beta). 
                               <br><br>
                               We take into account the ZCR as some fricative alophones such as [s],[z]... Have very small power and high ZCR.
                               Finally, we modify the .wav file by putting to 0 all the samples detected as SILENCE so a 'Noise cancellation system' is created.
